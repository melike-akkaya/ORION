### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- **Streamlit** library installed.
  
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run scripts and install packages on your machine.

---

### Requirements

Before installing and running the application, ensure you have the following databases:

- **asset tables in protein_index.db**: Generated by executing `./Uniprot-LLM/config/setUpDatabase.py`.
- **protein_embeddings.ann and protein_index.db**: Generated by executing `./Uniprot-LLM/config/implementVectorDatabase.py`.

NOTE: protein_embeddings.ann also can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aJTXtk0QiqiCiH2a-CK0mnund_4JwlGh

---

### Installation

#### 1. Create the Asset Database

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands:

**Windows:**

```bash
python .\config\setupdatabase.py
```

**macOS:**

```bash
python ./config/setupdatabase.py
```

---

#### 2. Create the Working Environment

Install the required packages by running:

**Windows:**

```bash
python .\config\installpackages.py
```

**macOS:**

```bash
python ./config/installpackages.py
```

---

#### 3. (Optional) Delete Previously Installed Libraries

If you encounter issues and need to uninstall all previously installed libraries, use the following commands:

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
pip freeze | %{$_.split('==')[0]} | %{pip uninstall -y $_}
```

**macOS:**

```bash
pip freeze | awk -F'==' '{print $1}' | xargs pip uninstall -y
```

**Linux:**


***1. Filter and Save Required Libraries to a File:***
   Generate a list of specific libraries you wish to uninstall and save them into a `requirements.txt` file using the command:

   ```bash
   pip freeze | grep -E 'streamlit|requests|langchain_openai|langchain_google_genai|langchain_anthropic|langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints|langchain|scikit-learn|langchain_mistralai|openpyxl|matplotlib|annoy|h5py' > requirements.txt
   ```

***2.Inspect the File: Review the list of libraries to be uninstalled to ensure accuracy:***
   ```bash
   cat requirements.txt
   ```
   Check for Local Packages: If there are any lines containing @ file:///, indicating a locally installed package, you will need to manually find the correct version to replace the path. Use the following command to find the version of a problematic module (replace <module_name> with the actual name of the module):
   ```bash
   pip show <module_name>
   ```
   After identifying the correct version, use a text editor like vim to manually replace the @ file:/// path in requirements.txt with the correct version number.
   ```bash
   vim requirements.txt
   ```

***3.Uninstall the Libraries: Uninstall the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file using:***
   ```bash
   cat requirements.txt | xargs -n1 pip uninstall -y
   ```


### Running the Program

#### Start the FastAPI Backend Server
From the backend/ directory:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Exposes two endpoints:
(1) POST /llm_query
(2) POST /vector_search

CORS is enabled for the frontend.

#### Start the Streamlit Frontend
Start the application by executing:

**Windows, macOS and Linux:**

```bash
python -m streamlit run main.py
```
